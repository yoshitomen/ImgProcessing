## Abstract
You can resize some small size images taken by old camera to 4times scale. 

It takes about 5-seconds to upconvert 225\*225 image to 900\*900.

## Environment
To use dnn_superres library, you need to install  
```
opencv-python  
opencv-contrib-python  
```
## How to use
When you place some images you want upconvert in `origin/` directly and run UpConvert.py, the upconverted images will be saved in `upconvert/`.
